# Linear Hashing
## Overview
Linear Hashing uses a systematic method of **growing data file**:
- Hash function **adapts to changing address range** (via ``sp`` and ``d``).
- Systematic splitting **controls length of overflow chains**.

Advantage: does not require auxiliary storage for directory.
Disadvantage: requires overflow pages (doesn't split on full pages).

## Method
File grows **linearly** (one page at a time, at regular intervals). Has phases of expansion; over each phase, ``b`` doubles.

## Selection with Linear Hashing
### Power of 2 Case
If ``b`` is a **power of 2**, the file behaves exactly **like standard hashing**. The ``d`` bits of the hash are used to compute the page address.

```py
# select * from R where k = val
h = hash(val)
P = bits(d, h) # lower order bits
for t in P
    if t.k == val:
        return t

for t in overflowPages(P):
    if t.k == val:
        return t
```

Average ``Cost_one = 1 + Ov``.

### Non-Power of 2 Case
If ``b`` is **not a power of 2**, **treat different parts of the file different**.

Parts A and C are treated as if part of a file of size ``2^(d + 1)``. Part B is treated as if part of a file of size ``2^d``. Part D does not yet exist (tuples in B may eventually move into it).

```py
h = hash(val)
pid = bits(d, h)

# only change is to use more bits if page is before split pointer
if pid < sp:
    pid - bits(d + 1, h)

for t in P
    if t.k == val:
        return t

for t in overflowPages(P):
    if t.k == val:
        return t
```

## Insertion with Linear Hashing
```py
pid = bits(d, hash(val))

if pid < sp:
    pid = bits(d + 1, hash(val))

P = getPage(f, pid)
for page in bucket(P):
    if space in page:
        page.insert(newTuple)
        break

if not insertion:
    newOverflowPage = addNewOverflowPage(P)
    newOverflowPage.insert(newTuple)

if needSplit:
    # partition tuples from bucket sp into buckets sp and sp + 2^d
    sp += 1
    if isPowerOf2(sp):
        d += 1
        sp = 0
```

### Splitting
Two approaches to triggering a split:
- Split every time a tuple is inserted into full page.
- Split when load factor reaches threshold (every ``k`` inserts).

Note: always split page ``sp``, even if not full or "current".

Systematic splitting:
- Eventually **reduces length of every overflow chain**.
- Helps to **maintain short average overflow chain length**.

![](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/21T1/lectures/linear-hashing/Pics/file-struct/linhash4.png)

```py
newsp = sp + 2 ** d
oldsp = sp

for t in P[oldsp] and overFlowPages(P[oldsp]):
    p = bits(d + 1, hash(t.k))

    if p == newp:
        bucket[newsp].add(t)
    else:
        bucket[oldsp].add(t)

sp += 1
if sp == 2 ** d:
    d += 1
    sp = 0
```

### Insertion Cost
If no split required, same as standard hashing:
- ``Cost_insert:`` Best: ``1_r + 1_w``, Average: ``(1 + Ov)_r + 1w``, Worst: ``(1 + max(Ov))_r + 2_W``.

If split occurs, incurs ``Cost_insert`` plus cost of splitting:
- Read page ``sp`` (plus all of its overflow pages).
- Write page ``sp`` (and its new overflow pages).
- Write page ``sp + 2^d`` (and its new overflow pages).

On average, ``Cost_split = (1 + Ov)_r + (2 + Ov)_w``.

## Deletion with Linear Hashing
Deletion is similar to ordinary static hash file. BUt might wish to contract file when enough tuples removed.

Method:
- **Remove last bucket** in data file (contracts linearly).
- **Merge tuples** from bucket with its **buddy page** (using ``d - 1`` hash bits).

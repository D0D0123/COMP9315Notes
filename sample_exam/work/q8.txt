desc(q) = 0100010100

start with matching = 11111111

bits 1, 5, 7 are set to '1' in desc(q)

therefore, fetch slices

[1] 10100101
[5] 11101001
[7] 10100001

matching = 11111111 & 10100101 = 10100101
matching = 10100101 & 11101001 = 10100001
matching = 10100001 & 10100001 = 10100001

bits 0, 2, 7 are set to '1' in matching

fetch pages 0, 2, 7

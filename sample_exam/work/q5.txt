a.  cost of projection using sorting for duplicate removal

Assumptions:
 - Writing temporary relations to disk instead of pipelining

R_o = 40
R_p = 20
b_o = 200
b_p = 100
b_r = 80

B = 31 buffers

Process:

1. Scan original relation 

cost = b_o = 200

2. Writing temporary relation, i.e. unsorted projection 

cost = b_p = 100

3. Sorting temporary relation (reads + writes):

cost = 2 * b_p * ceil(log_2(ceil(b_p / B)))
     = 2 * 100 * ceil(log_31(4))
     = 200

4. Scanning temporary relation and removing duplicates

cost = b_p = 100

5. Writing temp relation out

cost = b_r = 80

Total Cost = 200 + 100 + 200 + 100 + 80 = 680

b.  cost of projection using hashing for duplicate removal

Process:

1. Scan original relation:

cost = b_o = 200

2. Write partitions:

cost = b_p = 100

3. Read partitions to rehash and ignore duplicates:

cost = b_p = 100

4. Write out result relation:

cost = b_r = 80

Total Cost = 200 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 480
